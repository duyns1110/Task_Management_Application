This project was built based on my previous personal project. I decided to use it as the foundation for the required project because I realized that many components could be reused, and I didn’t have enough time to build everything from scratch.

To run this project, simply create a new environment and execute the following commands:
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- python run.py

Then, open http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to access my simple frontend demo. Alternatively, you can explore Swagger to see more of what I’ve built, which contains authorize feature I've learned and you have to install MongoDB to test those unnecessary things :).
